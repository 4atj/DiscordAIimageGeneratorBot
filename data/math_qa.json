Since the question is about percentages, the actual numbers will be meaningless, as only the ratio of that number versus others will be meaningful. Nonetheless, for those who are curious, each 1 / 7 portion represents ( 14210 / 7 ) 2,030 employees. This in turn means that 4,060 employees are journeymen and the remaining 10,150 are full time workers. If half the journeymen were laid off, that would mean 1 / 7 of the total current workforce would be removed. This statistic is what leads many students to think that since half the journeymen are left, the remaining journeymen would represent half of what they used to be, which means 1 / 7 of the total workforce. If 1 / 7 of the workforce is journeymen, and 1 / 7 is roughly 14.3 %, then answer choice a should be the right answer. In this case, though, it is merely the tempting trap answer choice. What changed between the initial statement and the final tally? Well, you let go of 1 / 7 of the workforce, so the total number of workers went down. The remaining workers are still 1 / 7 of the initial workers, but the group has changed. The new workforce is smaller than the original group, specifically 6 / 7 of it because 1 / 7 was eliminated. The remaining workers now account for 1 / 7 out of 6 / 7 of the force, which if we multiply by 7 gives us 1 out of 6. This number as a percentage is answer choice b, 28.6 %. Using the absolute numbers we calculated before, there were 4,060 journeymen employees out of 14,210 total. If 2,030 of them are laid off, then there are 2,030 journeyman employees left, but now out of a total of ( 14,210 - 2,030 ) 12,180 employees. 2,030 / 12,180 is exactly 1 / 6, or 16.67 %. The answer will work with either percentages or absolute numbers, but the percentage calculation will be significantly faster and applicable to any similar situation. The underlying principle of percentages ( and, on a related note, ratios ) can be summed up in the brainteaser i like to ask my students : if you \u2019 re running a race and you overtake the 2 nd place runner just before the end, what position do you end up in? The correct answer is 2 nd place. Percentages, like ratios and other concepts of relative math, depend entirely on the context. Whether 100 % more of something is better than 50 % more of something else depends on the context much more than the percentages quoted. When it comes to percentages on the gmat, the goal is to understand them enough to instinctively not fall into the traps laid out for you.

The current ratio of a to total mixture is 22.5 / 37.5; Expressed as a fraction this becomes ( 45 / 2 ) / ( 75 / 2 ), or 45 / 2 * 2 / 75. Canceling the 2 s and factoring out a 5 leaves the ratio as 9 / 15. Note, no need to reduce further as we're trying to figure out the amount of a and b in 15 l of solution. 9 / 15 of a means there must be 6 / 15 of b. Multiply each respective ratio by 15 to get 9 l of a and 6 l of b in the next 15 l removal. Final replacement the next 15 l removal means 9 liters of a and 6 liters of b are removed and replaced with 15 liters of b. 22.5 - 9 = 13.5 liters of a. 15 liters of b - 6 liters + 15 more liters = 24 liters of b. Test to the see if the final ratio = 9 / 16; 13.5 / 24 = ( 27 / 2 ) * ( 1 / 24 ) = 9 / 16.

Therefore, there will be 12 litres of milk in the mixture and 8 litres of water in the mixture. Step 1. When 10 litres of the mixture is removed, 6 litres of milk is removed and 4 litres of water is removed. Therefore, there will be 6 litres of milk and 4 litres of water left in the container. It is then replaced with pure milk of 10 litres. Now the container will have 16 litres of milk and 4 litres of water. Step 2. When 10 litres of the new mixture is removed, 8 litres of milk and 2 litres of water is removed. The container will have 8 litres of milk and 2 litres of water in it. Now 10 litres of pure milk is added. Therefore, the container will have 18 litres of milk and 2 litres of water in it at the end of the second step. Therefore, the ratio of milk and water is 18 : 2 or 9 : 1. Shortcut. We are essentially replacing water in the mixture with pure milk. Let w _ o be the amount of water in the mixture originally = 8 litres. Let w _ r be the amount of water in the mixture after the replacements have taken place. Then, { w _ r } / { w _ o } = ( 1 - r / m ) ^ n where r is the amount of the mixture replaced by milk in each of the steps, m is the total volume of the mixture and n is the number of times the cycle is repeated. Hence, { w _ r } / { w _ o } \u00a0 = ( 1 / 2 ) ^ 2 \u00a0 = 1 / 4 therefore e, w _ r \u00a0 = { w _ o } / 4 = 8 / 4 \u00a0 = 2 litres.

Let's call that number y. Let's first figure out what we're working with.

Now we need to figure out what we need to make 1512 * x into a cube of y ( y ^ 3 = 1512 * x ). We have two 5 s, two 3 s, and one 2. To arrange these numbers in identical triples ( 2, 3,7 ), we need at least one more 5, one 3, and two 2's. Each of these triples will give us the value of y ( 2 * 3 * 7 = 42 ), which, multiplied by itself three times, gives us 1512 * x. Looking at the factors we need to complete the triples, we get 7 * 7 = 49. We know this is the smallest number possible because prime factors by definition can not be broken down any further. Therefore, we can go with answer choice d. If time permits, we can do a sanity check. We calculated that y should be 2 * 3 * 7, or 42. 42 * 42 * 42 = 74088. Also, 1512 * 49 = 74088.

The values that are relevant to us are x = 3, x = 10 and x = - 2. Let us arrange these values in ascending order : - 2, 3 and 10. The quickest way to solve inequalities questions after arriving at these values is verifying whether the inequality holds good at the following intervals. Interval 1 : x < - 2. Pick a value in that range and check whether the inequality holds good. Let us take x = - 10. When x = - 10, x \u2212 3 / ( x \u2212 10 ) ( x + 2 ) < 0; The inequality does not hold good in this interval. Interval 2 : - 2 < x < 3. Let us take x = 0.

Since the least value of n for which n ^ 2 is a multiple of 72 is 12 then the largest positive integer that must divide n is 12. Complete solution of this question is given above. Please ask if anything remains unclear. I spent a few hours on this one alone and i'm still not clear. I chose 12 at first, but then changed to 48. I'm not a native speaker, so here is how i interpreted this question : the largest positive integer that must divide n = the largest positive factor of n. Since n is a variable ( i. E. N is moving ), so is its largest factor. Please correct if i'm wrong here. I know that if n = 12, n ^ 2 = 144 = 2 * 72 ( satisfy the condition ). When n = 12, the largest factor of n is n itself, which is 12. Check : 12 is the largest positive number that must divide 12 - - > true however if n = 48, n ^ 2 = 48 * 48 = 32 * 72 ( satisfy the condition too ). When n = 48, the largest factor of n is n itself, which is 48. Check : 48 is the largest positive number that must divide 48 - - > true so, i also notice that the keyword ismust, notcould. The question is, why is 48 notmust divide 48, but instead onlycould divide 48? I'm not clear right here. Why is 12 must divide 12? What's the difference between them? Only restriction we have on positive integer n is that n ^ 2 is divisible by 72. The least value of n for which n ^ 2 is divisible by 72 is 12, thus nmustbe divisible by 12 ( n is in any case divisible by 12 ). For all other values of n, for which n ^ 2 is divisible by 72, n will still be divisible by 12. This means that n is always divisible by 12 if n ^ 2 is divisible by 72. Now, ask yourself : if n = 12, is n divisible by 48? No. So, n is not always divisible by 48.

Each of those scenarios results in the same math : 0.032. Thus, we can simply multiply 0.032 by 3 to get 0.096, or a little less than 10 %.
